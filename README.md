## Requirements

* iOS 6.0 or higher
* ARC

## Feature

## Demo

Build and run the `MLImageCropDemo` project in Xcode to see `MLImageCrop` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `MLImageCrop` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.28.0** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add RESideMenu:

``` bash
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'MLImageCrop'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `MLImageCrop` files into your project, and add `#include "MLImageCropDemo.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.
